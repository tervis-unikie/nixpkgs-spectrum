Subject: [PATCH 5/7] sommelier: use stable xdg-shell protocol

From https://github.com/wayland-project/weston/commit/d8d9f5e6e16c8f6a3c06763d5f56c27dc9a6e52e:

> Some clients like the mpv video player now request the xdg_shell
> protocol so these will fail if the compositor only provides the
> xdg_shell_unstable_v6 protocol. Compositors like mir and gnome provide
> both protocols.
